app.js -> english router (/en) -> AuthPage (/auth) ->

UserAccount (/acnt) -> change accountName (/acntnamechange)

Switch and Router returns whatever matches what is on the
url

authentication process

first time logging in using google
outcome: 

onAuthStateChange =>
1.0 log in with google successfully
2.0 save to react state globally
3.0 pass the user uid to a function getUserData
and query the 'users' collection for the right uid,
if the user does exist return docSnap.data()
or not, return false

if result === false, which means the user does not exist
and is loggin in the first time, then go onto create/add
a document in the 'user's collection in firestore.

and if i do this, the document fileds have the right
